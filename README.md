# Kerala

**Kerala** is a distributed event-streaming server built for the modern day.  It is robust, lightweight and super fast!
- **Produce/Consume** - create Topics, then produce and consume them.
- **Process** - create processors that transform or aggregate event data, and project new Streams with the outputs.
- **Distribute** - scale & balance your event processors across your cluster.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **JDK 8** or above.

### Installing

Using the gradle wrapper, you can now run.

```bash
$ ./gradlew installDist
```

This will produce the **Kerala** daemon binary `kerala-server` under `./core/build/install/kerala-server/bin`

#### Run as `Standalone`

```bash
$ ./kerala-server
```

#### Run as `Cluster`

```bash
$ ./kerala-server --cluster :9191,:9292,:9393 --port :9191
$ ./kerala-server --cluster :9191,:9292,:9393 --port :9292
$ ./kerala-server --cluster :9191,:9292,:9393 --port :9393
```

#### Run with `Docker`

You can use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) OR run via [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml):

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

That will deploy a cluster containing 4 kerala nodes.

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

You can run unit tests as part of a build:

```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

Or, you can run them specifically:

```bash
$ ./gradlew test [--tests <package>|<regex>|<class-name>]
```

It is just vanilla Gradle so you can refer to the docs for more usages.  If you use Jetbrains IDEA, you can also run the tests within the editor.

## Coding Style

Kotlin is our core language and we currently enforce styling via `ktlint`.  `ktlint` will run automatically on a build task.

And can also run it directly:

```bash
$ ./gradlew ktlint
```

And have the formatting done for you:

```bash
$ ./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Kerala Use-Cases

There are numerous uses for event-streaming, here are just a few thing you could use **Kerala** for:

- Define a Topic of UI Events (PageView, PageScroll, PageSwipe, ButtonClick, TextInput, etc) to analyze customer interaction with your product, to gain insights and optimize your critical customer flows.
- Perform time-series analysis on all kinds of application event streams.
- Create app/system audit streams for retrospective analysis for fraud or unauthorized access use-cases.
- Natively supports [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) Architectures
- ...
